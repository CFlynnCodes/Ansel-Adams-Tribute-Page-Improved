            <b>Early Life:</b> Ansel Easton Adams was born on February 20, 1902 in
            San Francisco. He was the only son of Charles Hitchcock Adams and
            Olive Bray Adams. Initially Charles was involved with running of the
            lumber trading business established by his father. Later he set up an
            insurance agency and a chemical factory.

          <li>
            <b>1906-1907:</b> While they were living in San Francisco, a
            devastating earthquake shook the city. Four-year-old Ansel was thrust
            against a wall in an aftershock and broke his nose. It could not be
            repaired and he lived with a crooked nose all his life. The family
            moved to a new residence, from where one could see the Golden Gate and
            the Marin Headlands. Little Ansel, who was sickly and hyperactive,
            did not have many friends, but the landscape around his home kept him
            occupied.

            <b>1919:</b> He joined the Sierra Club, an organization devoted for
            protecting the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada. Thereafter from 1920
            to 1924, hstyle="text-align:center"e worked as the summer caretaker of its visitor center in
            Yosemite Valley. He also took part in the club’s high altitude treks.
          </li> <br>
          <li>
            <b>1922:</b> He had his first photograph published in the club’s
            bulletin. While it showed careful composition, music still remained
            his main focus. Therefore, while he spent the summer months hiking
            and photographing in the Sierra Nevada, the rest of the year was
            spent in improving his piano techniques. Over the time, he became
            more involved with the conservation programs of the Sierra Club.
            From the middle of the 1920s, he also started experimenting with
            soft-focus, etching, bromoil process, and other techniques.

            <b>1931:</b> Adams had his first solo exhibition at Smithsonian
            Institution, which earned fantastic reviews from the ‘Washington
            Post.’ In the following year, he had a group show with Imogen
            Cunningham and Edward Henry Weston at the M. H. de Young Museum.
            The success of the show prompted them to form Group f/64.
